Psalms.
Chapter 130.
A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh. 
Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions. 
If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? 
But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared. 
I wait for Yahweh. My soul waits. I hope in his word. 
My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning. 
Israel, hope in Yahweh, for there is loving kindness with Yahweh. Abundant redemption is with him. 
He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
