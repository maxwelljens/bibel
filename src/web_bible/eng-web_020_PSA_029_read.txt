Psalms.
Chapter 29.
A Psalm by David. Ascribe to Yahweh, you sons of the mighty, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength. 
Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. Worship Yahweh in holy array. 
Yahweh’s voice is on the waters. The God of glory thunders, even Yahweh on many waters. 
Yahweh’s voice is powerful. Yahweh’s voice is full of majesty. 
Yahweh’s voice breaks the cedars. Yes, Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. 
He makes them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young, wild ox. 
Yahweh’s voice strikes with flashes of lightning. 
Yahweh’s voice shakes the wilderness. Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. 
Yahweh’s voice makes the deer calve, and strips the forests bare. In his temple everything says, “Glory!” 
Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood. Yes, Yahweh sits as King forever. 
Yahweh will give strength to his people. Yahweh will bless his people with peace.
